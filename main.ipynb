The company's core team includes researchers and developers building interactive and immersive computer-vision tracking solutions. The team has extensive experience in artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, 3D Human–computer interaction (HCI) technology and augmented reality and virtual reality. uSens has been applying computer vision and AI technologies in AR/VR, Automotive and smartphones.  \\nuSens has its corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, with additional offices in China in Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe co-founder of uSens, Dr. Yue Fei, is a researcher in the field of 3D user interfaces and virtual reality who earned his PhD from Rice University in Space Physics.uSens has developed products in the area of HCI, such as the Fingo Virtual Touch, selling in China. Fingo Virtual Touch uses the company’s patented Fingo technology. Fingo is the hardware and software that uSens has developed to allow a user to interact with a digital interface, like a smart TV without the need to touch any surface; it can sense finger movements and hand gestures. It consists of a small sensor and a set of software algorithms that automatically “sense” and translate hand gestures into movements onscreen.In March 2015, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a VR/AR hardware product, reaching its initial funding goal within a few days. In February 2017, uSens announced that it would refund all Kickstarter backers.uSens announced a $20 million Series A funding round in June 2016 led by Fosun Kinzon Capital. Additional participants included returning investor Maison Capital, joined by new investors Great Capital, Fortune Capital, Oriental Fortune Capital, iResearch Capital, Chord Capital, and ARM Innovation Ecosystem Accelerator. The company previously received a pre-Series A investment of $5.5 million from co-led by IDG Ventures, Lebox Capital and Maison Capital.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAugmented reality\\nGesture recognition\\nMixed reality\\nMotion capture\\nVirtual reality\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\",\n",

       "  'raw_text': 'Augmented reality-assisted surgery (ARAS) is a surgical tool utilizing technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a surgeon’s view of the operative field, thus providing a composite view for the surgeon of the patient with a computer generated overlay enhancing the operative experience. It can be used for training, preparation for an operation, or performance of an operation. ARAS can be performed using a wide array of technology, including an optical head-mounted display (OHMD)—such as the Google Glass XE 22.1 or Vuzix STAR 1200 XL—and a digital overlay from robotic and laparoscopic surgery feeds. The technique has been primarily been tested in the urological and cardiovascular domains.\\n\\n\\n== Specialized uses ==\\nA subset of called augmented reality-assisted urologic surgery (ARAUS) specifically aids with urological surgery. This intraoperative training tool was first described and utilized by Tariq S. Hakky, Ryan M. Dickey, and Larry I. Lipshultz within the Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine, and Daniel R. Martinez, Rafael E. Carrion, and Philippe E. Spiess within the Sexual Medicine Program in the Department of Urology, at the University of South Florida. It was initially used to teach medical residents how to place a penile implant from start to finish via an application downloaded onto the OHMD. Intraoperatively, an optical display camera output feed combined with software allowing for the detection of points of interest enabled faculty to interact with residents during the placement of the penile implant. Both faculty and residents demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction of the ARAUS experience, and it was shown to be an effective tool in training urological surgical technique. Advantages of ARAUS include real-time feedback of residents during suy and superior visibility and interaction between faculty and residents.ARAS has also been applied to the cardiovascular realm. Terry Peters of the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada has teamed up with other researchers at the Robarts Research Institute to implement ARAS towards the goal of improving repairs to the heart\\'s mitral valve and replacement of the aortic valve. In an interview for the Medical Augmented Reality Blog, Peters stated that his research team could not only use ARAS to \"[improve] the speed and safety of the cardiac valve repair procedure\"; they also conducted \"the evaluation of an AR environment to plan brain-tumor removal, and the development of an ARF-enhanced system for ultrasound-guided spinal injections.\"Holosurical Inc has developed the clinically-tested ARAI™ surgical navigation system that provides real-time patient-specific 3D anatomical visualization for presurgical planning, intraoperative guidance, and postsurgical data analytics. The augmented reality component of the system allows the surgeon to focus their attention on the patient’s internal anatomy, without actually exposing it. On January 10th, 2019 HoloSurgical Inc completed the 1st spine surgery in the world using augmented reality, artificial intelligence-based navigation system. The system was developed by AI pioneer Paul Lewicki PhD, surgeon Kris Siemionow MD,PhD, and engineer Cristian Luciano PhD.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
