       "'Australia officially the Commonwealth of Australia is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the largest country in Oceania and the worlds sixth-largest country by total area. The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. Australias capital is Canberra and its largest city is Sydney. The countrys other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne Brisbane Perth and Adelaide. Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century who named it New Holland. In 1770 Australias eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 a date which became Australias national day. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades and by the time of an 1850s gold rush most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901 the six colonies federated forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and ten territories. Australia is the oldest flattest and driest inhabited continent with the least fertile soils. It has a landmass of 7617930 square kilometres. A megadiverse country its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates with deserts in the centre tropical rainforests in the north-east and mountain ranges in the south-east. Australia generates its income from various sources including mining-related exports telecommunications banking manufacturing and international education. Australia is a developed country with the worlds thirteenth-largest economy and tenth-highest per capita income. It is considered a regional power and has the worlds thirteenth-highest military expenditure. Immigrants account for 30 of the population the highest proportion in any country with a population over 10 million. The country ranks highly in measures of health education economic freedom and civil liberties. Australia is a member of the United Nations G20 Commonwealth of Nations ANZUS Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development World Trade Organization Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Pacific Islands Forum and the ASEAN Plus Six. Name The name Australia is derived from the Latin Terra Australis a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times. When Europeans first began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century the name Terra Australis was naturally applied to the new territories. Until the early 19th century Australia was best known as New Holland a name first applied by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1644 and subsequently anglicised. Terra Australis still saw occasional usage such as in scientific texts. The name Australia was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders who said it was more agreeable to the ear and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth. Several famous early cartographers also made use of the word Australia on maps. Gerardus Mercator used the phrase climata australia on his double cordiform map of the world of 1538 as did Gemma Frisius who was Mercators teacher and collaborator on his own cordiform wall map in 1540. Australia appears in a book on astronomy by Cyriaco Jacob zum Barth published in Frankfurt am Main in 1545.The first time that Australia appears to have been officially used was in April 1817 when Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledged the receipt of Flinders charts of Australia from Lord Bathurst. In December 1817 Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted. In 1824 the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name. The first official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of The Australia Directory by the Hydrographic Office. Colloquial names for Australia include Oz and the Land Down Under. Other epithets include the Great Southern Land the Lucky Country the Sunburnt Country and the Wide Brown Land. The latter two both derive from Dorothea Mackellars 1908 poem My Country. History Prehistory Human habitation of the Australian continent is known to have begun at least 65000 years ago with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings from what is now Southeast Asia. The Madjedbebe rock shelter in Arnhem Land is recognised as the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia. The oldest human remains found are the Lake Mungo remains which have been dated to around 41000 years ago. These people were the ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians. Aboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continual cultures on earth. At the time of first European contact most Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers with complex economies and societies. Recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 750000 could have been sustained. Indigenous Australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime. The Torres Strait Islanders ethnically Melanesian obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas. The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically by Makassan fishermen from what is now Indonesia. European arrival The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent are attributed to the Dutch. The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the Duyfken captained by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon. He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606 and made landfall on 26 February at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York. Later that year Spanish explorer Lu√≠s Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated Torres Strait islands. The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent New Holland during the 17th century and although no attempt at settlement was made a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or as in the case of the Batavia in 1629 marooned for mutiny and murder thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent. William Dampier an English explorer and privateer landed on the north-west coast of New Holland in 1688 and again in 1699 on a return trip. In 1770 James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast which he named New South Wales and claimed for Great Britain. With the loss of its American colonies in 1783 the British Government sent a fleet of ships the First Fleet under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip to establish a new penal colony in New South Wales. A camp was set up and the Union flag raised at Sydney Cove Port Jackson on 26 January 1788 a date which later became Australias national day Australia Day. Most early convicts were transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants upon arrival. While the majority settled into colonial society once emancipated convict rebellions and uprisings were also staged but invariably suppressed under martial law. The 1808 Rum Rebellion the only successful armed takeover of government in Australia instigated a two-year period of military rule. The indigenous population declined for 150 years following settlement mainly due to infectious disease. Thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers. A government policy of assimilation beginning with the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 resulted in the removal of many Aboriginal children from their families and communitiesreferred to as the Stolen Generationsa practice which also contributed to the decline in the indigenous population. As a result of the 1967 referendum the Federal governments power to enact special laws with respect to a particular race was extended to enable the making of laws with respect to Aboriginals. Traditional ownership of land was not recognised in law until 1992 when the High Court of Australia held in Mabo v Queensland that the legal doctrine that Australia had been terra nullius did not apply to Australia at the time of British settlement. Colonial expansion The expansion of British control over other areas of the continent began in the early 19th century initially confined to coastal regions. A settlement was established in Van Diemens Land in 1803 and it became a separate colony in 1825. In 1813 Gregory Blaxland William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney opening the interior to European settlement. The British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound. The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 evolving into the largest Australian colony by area Western Australia. In accordance with population growth separate colonies were carved from parts of New South Wales South Australia in 1836 New Zealand in 1841 Victoria in 1851 and Queensland in 1859. The Northern Territory was excised from South Australia in 1911. South Australia was founded as a free provinceit was never a penal colony. Western Australia was also founded free but later accepted transported convicts the last of which arrived in 1868 decades after transportation had ceased to the other colonies. By 1850 Europeans still had not entered large areas of the inland. Explorers remained ambitious to discover new lands for agriculture or answers to scientific enquiries. A series of gold rushes beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from China North America and mainland Europe and also spurred outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest. The latter peaked in 1854 when Ballarat miners launched the Eureka Rebellion against gold license fees. Between 1855 and 1890 the six colonies individually gained responsible government managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters notably foreign affairs defence and international shipping. Nationhood On 1 January 1901 federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning consultation and voting. After the 1907 Imperial Conference Australia and the other self-governing British colonies were given the status of dominion within the British Empire. The Federal Capital Territory was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra. Melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while Canberra was being constructed. The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in 1911. Australia became the colonial ruler of the Territory of Papua in 1902 and of the Territory of New Guinea in 1920. The two were unified as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in 1949 and gained independence from Australia in 1975.In 1914 Australia joined Britain in fighting World War I with support from both the outgoing Commonwealth Liberal Party and the incoming Australian Labor Party. Australians took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front. Of about 416000 who served about 60000 were killed and another 152000 were wounded. Many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps at Gallipoli as the birth of the nationits first major military action. The Kokoda Track campaign is regarded by many as an analogous nation-defining event during World War II.Britains Statute of Westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and the UK. Australia adopted it in 1942 but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the Australian Parliament during World War II. The shock of Britains defeat in Asia in 1942 followed soon after by the bombing of Darwin and other Japanese attacks led to a widespread belief in Australia that an invasion was imminent and a shift towards the United States as a new ally and protector. Since 1951 Australia has been a formal military ally of the US under the ANZUS treaty. After World War II Australia encouraged immigration from mainland Europe. Since the 1970s and following the abolition of the White Australia policy immigration from Asia and elsewhere was also promoted. As a result Australias demography culture and self-image were transformed. The Australia Act 1986 severed the remaining constitutional ties between Australia and the UK. In a 1999 referendum 55 of voters and a majority in every state rejected a proposal to become a republic with a president appointed by a two-thirds vote in both Houses of the Australian Parliament. There has been an increasing focus in foreign policy on ties with other Pacific Rim nations while maintaining close ties with Australias traditional allies and trading partners. Geography and environment General characteristics Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. The worlds smallest continent and sixth largest country by total area Australiaowing to its size and isolationis often dubbed the island continent and is sometimes considered the worlds largest island. Australia has 34218 kilometres of coastline and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of 8148250 square kilometres. This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory. Apart from Macquarie Island Australia lies between latitudes 9 and 44S and longitudes 112 and 154E.Australias size gives it a wide variety of landscapes with tropical rainforests in the north-east mountain ranges in the south-east south-west and east and desert in the centre. The desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land. Australia is the driest inhabited continent its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500 mm. The population density is 3.2 inhabitants per square kilometre although a large proportion of the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline. The Great Barrier Reef the worlds largest coral reef lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2000 kilometres. Mount Augustus claimed to be the worlds largest monolith is located in Western Australia. At 2228 metres Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland. Even taller are Mawson Peak on the remote Australian external territory of Heard Island and in the Australian Antarctic Territory Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies at 3492 metres and 3355 metres respectively. Eastern Australia is marked by the Great Dividing Range which runs parallel to the coast of Queensland New South Wales and much of Victoria. The name is not strictly accurate because parts of the range consist of low hills and the highlands are typically no more than 1600 metres in height. The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland and shrubland. These include the western plains of New South Wales and the Mitchell Grass Downs and Mulga Lands of inland Queensland. The northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical Cape York Peninsula. The landscapes of the Top End and the Gulf Countrywith their tropical climateinclude forest woodland wetland grassland rainforest and desert. At the north-west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of The Kimberley and below that the Pilbara. The Victoria Plains tropical savanna lies south of the Kimberly and Arnhem Land savannas forming a transition between the coastal savannas and the interior deserts. At the heart of the country are the uplands of central Australia. Prominent features of the centre and south include Uluru the famous sandstone monolith and the inland Simpson Tirari and Sturt Stony Gibson Great Sandy Tanami and Great Victoria deserts with the famous Nullarbor Plain on the southern coast. The Western Australian mulga shrublands lie between the interior deserts and Mediterranean-climate Southwest Australia. Geology Lying on the Indo-Australian Plate the mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on Earth with a relatively stable geological history. The landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over 3.8 billion years of the Earths history. The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean 3.62.7 Ga crusts identified on the Earth. Having been part of all major supercontinents the Australian continent began to form after the breakup of Gondwana in the Permian with the separation of the continental landmass from the African continent and Indian subcontinent. It separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the Permian and continuing through to the Cretaceous. When the last glacial period ended in about 10000 BC rising sea levels formed Bass Strait separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8000 and 6500 BC the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea separating New Guinea the Aru Islands and the mainland of Australia. The Australian continent is moving toward Eurasia at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a year. The Australian mainlands continental crust excluding the thinned margins has an average thickness of 38 km with a range in thickness from 24 km to 59 km. Australias geology can be divided into several main sections showcasing that the continent grew from west to east the Archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west Proterozoic fold belts in the centre and Phanerozoic sedimentary basins metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east. The Australian mainland and Tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and have no active volcanoes but due to passing over the East Australia hotspot recent volcanism has occurred during the Holocene in the Newer Volcanics Province of western Victoria and southeastern South Australia. Volcanism also occurs in the island of New Guinea and in the Australian external territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands. Seismic activity in the Australian mainland and Tasmania is also low with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the 1989 Newcastle earthquake. Climate The climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Ni√±oSouthern Oscillation which is correlated with periodic drought and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia. These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical predominantly summer-rainfall. The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate. The south-east ranges from oceanic to humid subtropical with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates. The interior is arid to semi-arid. Driven by climate change average temperatures have risen more than 1C since 1960. Associated changes in rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues such as drought and bushfires. 2019 was Australias warmest recorded year and the 201920 bushfire season was the countrys worst on record. Australias greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world. Water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought. Throughout much of the continent major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought flushing out inland river systems overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains as occurred throughout Eastern Australia in 2010 2011 and 2012 after the 2000s Australian drought. Biodiversity Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests. Fungi typify that diversityan estimated 250000 speciesof which only 5 have been describedoccur in Australia. Because of the continents great age extremely variable weather patterns and long-term geographic isolation much of Australias biota is unique. About 85 of flowering plants 84 of mammals more than 45 of birds and 89 of in-shore temperate-zone fish are endemic. Australia has at least 755 species of reptile more than any other country in the world. Besides Antarctica Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species. Feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks and later in the 18th century by European settlers. They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species. Australian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts. Among well-known Australian animals are the monotremes a host of marsupials including the kangaroo koala and wombat and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra. Australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world. The dingo was introduced by Austronesian people who traded with Indigenous Australians around 3000 BCE. Many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement including the Australian megafauna others have disappeared since European settlement among them the thylacine. Many of Australias ecoregions and the species within those regions are threatened by human activities and introduced animal chromistan fungal and plant species. All these factors have led to Australias having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species. Numerous protected areas have been created under the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australias Biological Diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems 65 wetlands are listed under the Ramsar Convention and 16 natural World Heritage Sites have been established. Australia was ranked 21st out of 178 countries in the world on the 2018 Environmental Performance Index. There are more than 1800 animals and plants on Australias threatened species list including more than 500 animals. Government and politics Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The country has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system under its constitution which is one of the worlds oldest since Federation in 1901. It is also one of the worlds oldest federations in which power is divided between the federal and state and territorial governments. The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom and the United States along with distinctive indigenous features. The federal government is separated into three branchesLegislature the bicameral Parliament comprising the monarch the Senate and the House of RepresentativesExecutive the Federal Executive Council which in practice gives legal effect to the decisions of the cabinet comprising the prime minister and other ministers of state appointed by the governor-general on the advice of ParliamentJudiciary the High Court of Australia and other federal courts whose judges are appointed by the governor-general on advice of ParliamentElizabeth II reigns as Queen of Australia and is represented in Australia by the governor-general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level who by convention act on the advice of her ministers. Thus in practice the governor-general acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the Federal Executive Council. The governor-general does have extraordinary reserve powers which may be exercised outside the prime ministers request in rare and limited circumstances the most notable exercise of which was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the constitutional crisis of 1975.In the Senate there are 76 senators twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories. The House of Representatives has 151 members elected from single-member electoral divisions commonly known as electorates or seats allocated to states on the basis of population with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats. Elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously senators have overlapping six-year terms except for those from the territories whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house thus only 40 of the 76 places in the Senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution. Australias electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which along with the Senate and most state upper houses combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote. Voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction as is enrolment. The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes Prime Minister. In cases where no party has majority support the Governor-General has the constitutional power to appoint the Prime Minister and if necessary dismiss one that has lost the confidence of Parliament. There are two major political groups that usually form government federally and in the states the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner the National Party. Within Australian political culture the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left. Independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in Australian parliaments mostly in upper houses. The Australian Greens are often considered the third force in politics being the third largest party by both vote and membership. The most recent federal election was held on 18 May 2019 and resulted in the Coalition led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison retaining government. States and territories Australia has six statesNew South Wales Queensland South Australia Tasmania Victoria and Western Australia and two major mainland territoriesthe Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. In most respects these two territories function as states except that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments. Under the constitution the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject whereas the Commonwealth Parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section 51. For example state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education criminal law and state police health transport and local government but the Commonwealth Parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas. However Commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency. In addition the Commonwealth has the power to levy income tax which coupled with the power to make grants to States has given it the financial means to incentivise States to pursue specific legislative agendas within areas over which the Commonwealth does not have legislative power. Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliamentunicameral in the Northern Territory the ACT and Queensland and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The Queen is represented in each state by a governor and in the Northern Territory the administrator. In the Commonwealth the Queens representative is the governor-general. The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the external territories of Ashmore and Cartier Islands Christmas Island the Cocos Islands the Coral Sea Islands Heard Island and McDonald Islands and the claimed region of Australian Antarctic Territory as well as the internal Jervis Bay Territory a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales. The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the Queen. In 2015 the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council. Macquarie Island is part of Tasmania and Lord Howe Island of New South Wales. Foreign relations Over recent decades Australias foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the United States through the ANZUS pact and by a desire to develop relationships with Asia and the Pacific particularly through ASEAN the Pacific Islands Forum and the Pacific Community of which Australia is a founding member. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the East Asia Summit following its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia and in 2011 attended the Sixth East Asia Summit in Indonesia. Australia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations in which the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings provide the main forum for co-operation. Australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation. It led the formation of the Cairns Group and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Australia is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Trade Organization and has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements most recently the AustraliaUnited States Free Trade Agreement and Closer Economic Relations with New Zealand with another free trade agreement being negotiated with Chinathe AustraliaChina Free Trade Agreementand Japan South Korea in 2011 AustraliaChile Free Trade Agreement and as of November 2015 has put the Trans-Pacific Partnership before parliament for ratification. Australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring New Zealand with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and free trade under the AustraliaNew Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. New Zealand Canada and the United Kingdom are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by Australian people. Along with New Zealand the United Kingdom Malaysia and Singapore Australia is party to the Five Power Defence Arrangements a regional defence agreement. A founding member country of the United Nations Australia is strongly committed to multilateralism and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance. The 200506 budget provides A2.5 billion for development assistance. Australia ranks fifteenth overall in the Center for Global Developments 2012 Commitment to Development Index. Military Australias armed forcesthe Australian Defence Force comprise the Royal Australian Navy the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force in total numbering 81214 personnel as of November 2015. The titular role of Commander-in-Chief is vested in the Governor-General who appoints a Chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services on the advice of the government. Day-to-day force operations are under the command of the Chief while broader administration and the formulation of defence policy is undertaken by the Minister and Department of Defence. In the 201617 budget defence spending comprised 2 of GDP representing the worlds 12th largest defence budget. Australia has been involved in UN and regional peacekeeping disaster relief and armed conflict including the 2003 invasion of Iraq Australia currently has deployed about 2241 personnel in varying capacities to 12 international operations in areas including Iraq and Afghanistan. Economy A wealthy country Australia has a market economy a high GDP per capita and a relatively low rate of poverty. In terms of average wealth Australia ranked second in the world after Switzerland from 2013 until 2018. In 2018 Australia overtook Switzerland and became the country with the highest average wealth. Australias poverty rate increased from 10.2 to 11.8 from 200001 to 2013. It was identified by the Credit Suisse Research Institute as the nation with the highest median wealth in the world and the second-highest average wealth per adult in 2013.The Australian dollar is the currency for the nation including Christmas Island Cocos Islands and Norfolk Island as well as the independent Pacific Island states of Kiribati Nauru and Tuvalu. With the 2006 merger of the Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange the Australian Securities Exchange became the ninth largest in the world. Ranked fifth in the Index of Economic Freedom Australia is the worlds 13th largest economy and has the tenth highest per capita GDP at US55692. The country was ranked third in the United Nations 2017 Human Development Index. Melbourne reached top spot for the fourth year in a row on The Economists 2014 list of the worlds most liveable cities followed by Adelaide Sydney and Perth in the fifth seventh and ninth places respectively. Total government debt in Australia is about A190 billion20 of GDP in 2010. Australia has among the highest house prices and some of the highest household debt levels in the world. An emphasis on exporting commodities rather than manufactured goods has underpinned a significant increase in Australias terms of trade since the start of the 21st century due to rising commodity prices. Australia has a balance of payments that is more than 7 of GDP negative and has had persistently large current account deficits for more than 50 years. Australia has grown at an average annual rate of 3.6 for over 15 years in comparison to the OECD annual average of 2.5.Australia was the only advanced economy not to experience a recession due to the global financial downturn in 20082009. However the economies of six of Australias major trading partners have been in recession which in turn has affected Australia significantly hampering its economic growth in recent years. From 2012 to early 2013 Australias national economy grew but some non-mining states and Australias non-mining economy experienced a recession. The Hawke Government floated the Australian dollar in 1983 and partially deregulated the financial system. The Howard Government followed with a partial deregulation of the labour market and the further privatisation of state-owned businesses most notably in the telecommunications industry. The indirect tax system was substantially changed in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10 Goods and Services Tax. In Australias tax system personal and company income tax are the main sources of government revenue. As of September 2018 there were 12640800 people employed with an unemployment rate of 5.2. Data released in mid-November 2013 showed that the number of welfare recipients had grown by 55. In 2007 228621 Newstart unemployment allowance recipients were registered a total that increased to 646414 in March 2013. According to the Graduate Careers Survey full-time employment for newly qualified professionals from various occupations has declined since 2011 but it increases for graduates three years after graduation. Since 2008 inflation has typically been 23 and the base interest rate 56. The service sector of the economy including tourism education and financial services accounts for about 70 of GDP. Rich in natural resources Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products particularly wheat and wool minerals such as iron-ore and gold and energy in the forms of liquified natural gas and coal. Although agriculture and natural resources account for only 3 and 5 of GDP respectively they contribute substantially to export performance. Australias largest export markets are Japan China the United States South Korea and New Zealand. Australia is the worlds fourth largest exporter of wine and the wine industry contributes A5.5 billion per year to the nations economy. Access to biocapacity in Australia is much higher than world average. In 2016 Australia had 12.3 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory much more than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016 Australia used 6.6 global hectares of biocapacity per person their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use half as much biocapacity as Australia contains. As a result Australia is running a biocapacity reserve. In 2020 ACOSS released a new report revealing that poverty is growing in Australia with an estimated 3.2 million people or 13.6 of the population living below the internationally accepted poverty line of 50 of a countrys median income. It also estimated that there are 774000 children under the age of 15 that are in poverty. Demographics Australia has an average population density of 3.4 persons per square kilometre of total land area which makes it is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast and in particular in the south-eastern region between South East Queensland to the north-east and Adelaide to the south-west. Australia is highly urbanised with 67 of the population living in the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas in 2018. Metropolitan areas with more than one million inhabitants are Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth and Adelaide. In common with many other developed countries Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2018 the average age of the Australian population was 38.8 years. In 2015 2.15 of the Australian population lived overseas one of the lowest proportions worldwide. Ancestry and immigration Between 1788 and the Second World War the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century. In the decades immediately following the Second World War Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973 Australia has pursued an official policy of multiculturalism and there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century. Today Australia has the worlds eighth-largest immigrant population with immigrants accounting for 30 of the population a higher proportion than in any other nation with a population of over 10 million. 160323 permanent immigrants were admitted to Australia in 201819 whilst there was a net population gain of 239600 people from all permanent and temporary immigration in that year. The majority of immigrants are skilled but the immigration program includes categories for family members and refugees. In 2019 the largest foreign-born populations were those born in England Mainland China India New Zealand the Philippines and Vietnam.In the 2016 Australian census the most commonly nominated ancestries wereAt the 2016 census 649171 people identified as being IndigenousAboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. Indigenous Australians experience higher than average rates of imprisonment and unemployment lower levels of education and life expectancies for males and females that are respectively 11 and 17 years lower than those of non-indigenous Australians. Some remote Indigenous communities have been described as having failed state-like conditions. Language Although Australia has no official language English is the de facto national language. Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling. General Australian serves as the standard dialect. According to the 2016 census English is the only language spoken in the home for 72.7 of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin Arabic Cantonese Vietnamese and Italian. A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual. Over 250 Indigenous Australian languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact of which fewer than twenty are still in daily use by all age groups. About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people. At the time of the 2006 census 52000 Indigenous Australians representing 12 of the Indigenous population reported that they spoke an Indigenous language at home. Australia has a sign language known as Auslan which is the main language of about 10112 deaf people who reported that they spoke Auslan language at home in the 2016 census. Religion Australia has no state religion Section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the federal government from making any law to establish any religion impose any religious observance or prohibit the free exercise of any religion. In the 2016 census 52.1 of Australians were counted as Christian including 22.6 as Catholic and 13.3 as Anglican 30.1 of the population reported having no religion 8.2 identify with non-Christian religions the largest of these being Islam followed by Buddhism Hinduism Sikhism and Judaism. The remaining 9.7 of the population did not provide an adequate answer. Those who reported having no religion increased conspicuously from 19 in 2006 to 22 in 2011 to 30.1 in 2016.Before European settlement the animist beliefs of Australias indigenous people had been practised for many thousands of years. Mainland Aboriginal Australians spirituality is known as the Dreamtime and it places a heavy emphasis on belonging to the land. The collection of stories that it contains shaped Aboriginal law and customs. Aboriginal art story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. The spirituality and customs of Torres Strait Islanders who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea reflected their Melanesian origins and dependence on the sea. The 1996 Australian census counted more than 7000 respondents as followers of a traditional Aboriginal religion. Since the arrival of the First Fleet of British ships in 1788 Christianity has become the major religion practised in Australia. Christian churches have played an integral role in the development of education health and welfare services in Australia. For much of Australian history the Church of England was the largest religious denomination with a large Roman Catholic minority. However multicultural immigration has contributed to a steep decline in its relative position since the Second World War. Similarly Islam Buddhism Hinduism Sikhism and Judaism have all grown in Australia over the past half-century. Australia has one of the lowest levels of religious adherence in the world. In 2001 only 8.8 of Australians attended church on a weekly basis. Health Australias life expectancy is the fourth highest in the world for males and the third highest for females. Life expectancy in Australia in 20142016 was 80.4 years for males and 84.6 years for females. Australia has the highest rates of skin cancer in the world while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease responsible for 7.8 of the total mortality and disease. Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6 with obesity third at 7.5. Australia ranks 35th in the world and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults and nearly two thirds of its adult population is either overweight or obese. Total expenditure on health is around 9.8 of GDP. Australia introduced universal health care in 1975. Known as Medicare it is now nominally funded by an income tax surcharge known as the Medicare levy currently at 2. The states manage hospitals and attached outpatient services while the Commonwealth funds the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and general practice. Education School attendance or registration for home schooling is compulsory throughout Australia. Education is the responsibility of the individual states and territories so the rules vary between states but in general children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16. In some states children aged 1617 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training such as an apprenticeship. Australia has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99 in 2003. However a 201112 report for the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Tasmania has a literacy and numeracy rate of only 50. In the Programme for International Student Assessment Australia regularly scores among the top five of thirty major developed countries. Catholic education accounts for the largest non-government sector. Australia has 37 government-funded universities and three private universities as well as a number of other specialist institutions that provide approved courses at the higher education level. The OECD places Australia among the most expensive nations to attend university. There is a state-based system of vocational training known as TAFE and many trades conduct apprenticeships for training new tradespeople. About 58 of Australians aged from 25 to 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications and the tertiary graduation rate of 49 is the highest among OECD countries. 30.9 percent of Australias population has attained a higher education qualification which is among the highest percentages in the world. Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin with 812000 international students enrolled in the nations universities and vocational institutions in 2019. Accordingly in 2019 international students represented on average 26.7 of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education therefore represents one of the countrys largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the countrys demographics with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas. Culture Since 1788 the primary influence behind Australian culture has been Anglo-Celtic Western culture with some Indigenous influences. The divergence and evolution that has occurred in the ensuing centuries has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture. The culture of the United States has served as a significant influence particularly through television and cinema. Other cultural influences come from neighbouring Asian countries and through large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking nations. Arts Australia has over 100000 Aboriginal rock art sites and traditional designs patterns and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art the last great art movement of the 20th century according to critic Robert Hughes its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye. Early colonial artists showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land. The impressionistic works of Arthur Streeton Tom Roberts and other members of the 19th-century Heidelberg Schoolthe first distinctively Australian movement in Western artgave expression to nationalist sentiments in the lead-up to Federation. While the school remained influential into the 1900s modernists such as Margaret Preston and later Sidney Nolan and Arthur Boyd explored new artistic trends. The landscape remained a central subject matter for Fred Williams Brett Whiteley and other post-war artists whose works eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian moved between the figurative and the abstract. The national and state galleries maintain collections of local and international art. Australia has one of the worlds highest attendances of art galleries and museums per head of population. Australian literature grew slowly in the decades following European settlement though Indigenous oral traditions many of which have since been recorded in writing are much older. In the 1870s Adam Lindsay Gordon posthumously became the first Australian poet to attain a wide readership. Following in his footsteps Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson captured the experience of the bush using a distinctive Australian vocabulary. Their works are still popular Patersons bush poem Waltzing Matilda is regarded as Australias unofficial national anthem. Miles Franklin is the namesake of Australias most prestigious literary prize awarded annually to the best novel about Australian life. Its first recipient Patrick White went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973. Australian Booker Prize winners include Peter Carey Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan. Author David Malouf playwright David Williamson and poet Les Murray are also renowned. Many of Australias performing arts companies receive funding through the federal governments Australia Council. There is a symphony orchestra in each state and a national opera company Opera Australia well known for its famous soprano Joan Sutherland. At the beginning of the 20th century Nellie Melba was one of the worlds leading opera singers. Ballet and dance are represented by The Australian Ballet and various state companies. Each state has a publicly funded theatre company. Media The Story of the Kelly Gang the worlds first feature-length narrative film spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era. After World War I Hollywood monopolised the industry and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased. With the benefit of government support the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films many exploring themes of national identity such as Wake in Fright and Gallipoli while Crocodile Dundee and the Ozploitation movements Mad Max series became international blockbusters. In a film market flooded with foreign content Australian films delivered a 7.7 share of the local box office in 2015. The AACTAs are Australias premier film and television awards and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush Nicole Kidman Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger. Australia has two public broadcasters three commercial television networks several pay-TV services and numerous public non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least one daily newspaper and there are two national daily newspapers The Australian and The Australian Financial Review. In 2010 Reporters Without Borders placed Australia 18th on a list of 178 countries ranked by press freedom behind New Zealand but ahead of the United Kingdom and United States. This relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia most print media are under the control of News Corporation and after Fairfax Media was merged with Nine Nine Entertainment Co. Cuisine Most Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet of native fauna and flora otherwise called bush tucker. The first settlers introduced British food to the continent much of which is now considered typical Australian food such as the Sunday roast. Multicultural immigration transformed Australian cuisine post-World War II European migrants particularly from the Mediterranean helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture and the influence of Asian cultures has led to Australian variants of their staple foods such as the Chinese-inspired dim sim and Chiko Roll. Vegemite pavlova lamingtons and meat pies are regarded as iconic Australian foods. Australian wine is produced mainly in the southern cooler parts of the country. Australia is also known for its cafe and coffee culture in urban centres which has influenced coffee culture abroad including New York City. Australia was responsible for the flat white coffeepurported to have originated in a Sydney cafe in the mid-1980s. Sport and recreation Cricket and football are the predominate sports in Australia during the summer and winter months respectively. Australia is unique in that it has professional leagues for four football codes. Originating in Melbourne in the 1850s Australian rules football is the most popular code in all states except New South Wales and Queensland where rugby league holds sway followed by rugby union the imaginary border separating areas where Australian rules football dominates from those were the two rugby codes prevail is known as the Barassi Line. Soccer while ranked fourth in popularity and resources has the highest overall participation rates. Cricket is popular across all borders and has been regarded by many Australians as the national sport. The Australian national cricket team competed against England in the first Test match and the first One Day International and against New Zealand in the first Twenty20 International winning all three games. It has also participated in every edition of the Cricket World Cup winning the tournament a record five times. Australia is also notable for water-based sports such as swimming and surfing. The surf lifesaving movement originated in Australia and the volunteer lifesaver is one of the countrys icons. Nationally other popular sports include horse racing basketball and motor racing. The annual Melbourne Cup horse race and the Sydney to Hobart yacht race attract intense interest. In 2016 the Australian Sports Commission revealed that swimming cycling and soccer are the three most popular participation sports. Australia is one of five nations to have participated in every Summer Olympics of the modern era and has hosted the Games twice 1956 in Melbourne and 2000 in Sydney. Australia has also participated in every Commonwealth Games hosting the event in 1938 1962 1982 2006 and 2018. Australia made its inaugural appearance at the Pacific Games in 2015. As well as being a regular FIFA World Cup participant Australia has won the OFC Nations Cup four times and the AFC Asian Cup oncethe only country to have won championships in two different FIFA confederations. In June 2020 Australia won its bid to co-host the 2023 FIFA Womens World Cup with New Zealand. The country regularly competes among the world elite basketball teams as it is among the global top three teams in terms of qualifications to the Basketball Tournament at the Summer Olympics. Other major international events held in Australia include the Australian Open tennis grand slam tournament international cricket matches and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix. The highest-rating television programs include sports telecasts such as the Summer Olympics FIFA World Cup The Ashes Rugby League State of Origin and the grand finals of the National Rugby League and Australian Football League. Skiing in Australia began in the 1860s and snow sports take place in the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania.
