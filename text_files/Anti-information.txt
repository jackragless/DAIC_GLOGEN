Information is that which reduces uncertainty, wholly or in part.
Similarly, anti-information is that which increases uncertainty.
It is negative information.
Noise on a noisy communication channel is an example of anti-information.
According to Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem
the entropy of the noise must be subtracted to obtain the channel capacity
that remains available for reliable communication.
The gambling industry has made a business out of selling anti-information.
People are willing to pay for anti-information.
The increase in uncertainty enables them to savor the information that they subsequently receive
when the uncertainty is finally resolved.
The term anti-information was introduced by Koos Verhoeff in the 1970s
while teaching informatics at the Erasmus University Rotterdam.
