In addition, metaio|9| also released the Unifeye|10| Platform which enabled third-party developers|11| to create their own commercial AR solutions. In 2006 metaio released the first browsing plug-in for web-based AR applications.
Shortly thereafter, Metaio launched the first fully integrated AR application for mobile devices|12| with the release of the mobile AR browser Junaio.
From 2010 to 2012, Metaio presented the first commercial 2-D|13| Markerless Feature tracking application for print and television on a consumer mobile device and as a result won the ISMAR|14| Tracking Contest in 2011.
