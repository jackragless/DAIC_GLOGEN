== History ==
The co-founder|2| of uSens, Dr. Yue Fei, is a researcher in the field of 3D user interfaces and virtual reality who earned his PhD from Rice University in Space Physics.uSens|3| has developed products in the area of HCI, such as the Fingo Virtual Touch, selling in China. Fingo Virtual Touch uses the company’s patented Fingo technology. Fingo is the hardware and software that uSens has developed to allow a user to interact with a digital interface, like a smart TV|4| without the need to touch any surface; it can sense finger movements and hand gestures. It consists of a small sensor and a set of software algorithms that automatically “sense” and translate hand gestures|5| into movements onscreen.In March 2015, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a VR/AR hardware product, reaching its initial funding goal within a few days. In February 2017, uSens announced that it would refund all Kickstarter backers.uSens announced a $20 million Series A funding round in June 2016 led by Fosun Kinzon Capital. Additional participants included returning investor Maison Capital, joined by new investors Great Capital, Fortune Capital, Oriental Fortune Capital, iResearch Capital, Chord|6| Capital, and ARM|7| Innovation Ecosystem Accelerator.
