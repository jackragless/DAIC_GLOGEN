===DOCUMENT BODY===

Overload is a bi-monthly professional computer magazine published by ACCU, that was established in 1993 and is edited by Frances Buontempo. It aims to "publish a high standard of articles about all aspects of software development". All issues of Overload, starting from August 1998, are available online.


== History ==
Overload was started in 1993 as a magazine of the "Turbo C++ SIG". By 1994, it had become a "journal of C++ SIG", with an appropriate change in scope. At that time there were several magazines with similar scope, including C/C++|1| Users Journal, C++|2| Report, and to a lesser extent, Dr. Dobb's Journal. The scope of Overload continued to be broadened and in 2000 the magazine was relabeled from "journal of C++ SIG" to "journal of ACCU". About the same time, a board of "readers" was established, to assist authors with improving their articles.Over time, many competing publications have been discontinued|3| (C++ Report has been discontinued in 2002, C/C++ Users Journal in 2006, Dr Dobbs Journal in 2009), and by 2010 Overload has become the only magazine to cover this area, which has attracted articles of notable|4| writers such as former contributing editor of C/C++ Users Journal Matthew Wilson and creator of C++ Bjarne Stroustrup.Since its establishment, the scope of the magazine has evolved|5| from issues specific to C/C++ into all aspects of software development, with a particular emphasis on Agile software development. In 2005 Overload published a Quality Manifesto|6| by Tom Gilb.
